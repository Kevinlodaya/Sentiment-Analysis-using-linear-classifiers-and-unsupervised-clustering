# Sentiment-Analysis-using-linear-classifiers-and-unsupervised-clustering
This project aims to train linear classification models that can recognize the reviewer's sentiment. In this project, we will deal only with positive and negative sentiments (binary classification).

- Pandas for data frames and easy-to-read CSV files.

- Numpy for array and matrix mathematics functions.

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

- sklearn for the metrics and pre-processing.

- scipy for helper functions required at various stages of the project.

- warnings are used to suppress notifications from different libraries used in the project.
