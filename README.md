# Sentiment-Analysis-using-linear-classifiers-and-unsupervised-clustering
The goal of this project is to train linear classification models that can recognize the sentiment of the reviewer. In this project we will be dealing with only positive and negative sentiments (binary classification).

Pandas for data frames and easy to read csv files
Numpy for array and matrix mathematics functions
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
sklearn for the metrics and pre-processing
scipy for helper functions required at various stages of the project.
warnings is used to supress warnings from different libraries used in the project.
